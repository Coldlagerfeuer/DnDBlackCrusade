If the Willpower test is passed the character is unaffected by the psychic power. If the test is failed then the psychic power affects him as normal and he becomes Frenzied in addition to any other effects. The effects of this talent only apply to powers that directly affect the character (such as targeted powers or powers which catch him in their area of effect) and not powers which may harm him indirectly (such as attack from summoned daemons or falling or flung debris from a telekinetic).

A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result.
