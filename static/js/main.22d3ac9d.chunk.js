This bonus to PR does not in\ufb02uence the Psychic Strength in any way; their bene\ufb01t is applied after determining whether a power is used at the Unfettered, Fettered or Push level.

If the Willpower test is passed the character is unaffected by the psychic power. If the test is failed then the psychic power affects him as normal and he becomes Frenzied in addition to any other effects. The effects of this talent only apply to powers that directly affect the character (such as targeted powers or powers which catch him in their area of effect) and not powers which may harm him indirectly (such as attack from summoned daemons or falling or flung debris from a telekinetic). In addition, powers used by friendly psykers must also be resisted (and also cause Frenzy should he fail to resist them).

It can change size by one-step in either direction, though doing so does not change its speed. Creatures with this trait determine their movement rates using one-half their Agility Bonus rounded up. Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on the Unnatural Senses Trait to perceive their surroundings."},"Auto-Stabilised":{name:"Auto-Stabilised",tier:0,description:"The creature always counts as braced when firing heavy weapons and therefore may fire a ranged weapon on full or semi-automatic without taking the Brace action first without suffering any penalties to hit."},Bestial:{name:"Bestial",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this trait never needs to make a Survival Skill Test whilst in its natural habitat.

On a failed test, the creature flees."},Blind:{name:"Blind",tier:0,description:"Blind creatures automatically fail all tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a \u201330 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision. Note that this Trait indicates not only that the creature cannot see but that it also has no other senses which would provide the same benefit as eyes.

The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when burrowing. Such creatures can burrow through soil, rock, sand, and so on, though some (expressed in the creature entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel.

There\u2019s a 50% chance each round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature."},Crawler:{name:"Crawler",tier:0,description:"Worms, serpents, and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk.

Creatures with this trait increase their Toughness Bonus against all Damage by the number indicated in the parenthesis (X) in the same manner as an Unnatural Characteristic (see Unnatural Characteristics trait on page 144). The effects of this trait stack with the effects of the Unnatural Characteristic trait. This increase is negated by Damage inflicted by force weapons, psychic powers, holy attacks, or other creatures with this trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune to poison and disease. Creatures with the Daemonic trait also gain benefits when using Psychic Powers as detailed in Chapter VI: The Powers of the Warp."},"Dark-Sight":{name:"Dark-Sight",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness, and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting."},Fear:{name:"Fear",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait has an unnerving appearance. The fear of it always has an associated rating (1\u20134) to reflect just how awful the creature is to behold and is indicated by the number in parenthesis (X). The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going encounter, as shown on Table 4-7: Fear Ratings. When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, they must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature\u2019s trait. On a success, the character may act as normal. On a failure, the character must roll on Table 8-4: Shock (see page 277), adding +10 to the roll for every Degree of Failure by which the Willpower Test was failed."},Flyer:{name:"Flyer",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait has the natural ability to fly, whether with broad leathery wings, strange Warp energies, or inflatable gas sacs.

For more details on flying, see Chapter I: Playing the Game."},Incorporeal:{name:"Incorporeal",tier:0,description:"Incorporeal creatures are insubstantial and weightless, able to pass through solid objects such as walls and weapons. An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Stealth Tests due to their ability to merge with objects and the fact they make practically no sounds when they move. Incorporeal creatures gain the Hoverer (6) trait. An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons\u2014they simply pass through its body as if it wasn\u2019t there. Daemons, psychic powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can\u2019t normally affect the mortal world, and thus can\u2019t Damage non-incorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally. Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, most notably the Gellar Field of a spaceship. Creatures with this trait cannot pass through such a field."},Machine:{name:"Machine",tier:0,description:"A creature with the Machine trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous then fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold, any mind-influencing psychic effect, and their Armour Points apply toward fire Damage. Machines have a certain number of Armour Points (indicated by the number in parentheses). This armour stacks with worn armour, but not with the Natural Armour Trait."},"Multiple Arms":{name:"Multiple Arms",tier:0,description:"This creature has more than one pair of arms. The exact number of arms is indicated in parenthesis (X), so a Genestealer with Multiple Arms (4) has four arms total. It gains a +10 bonus on Athletics Tests involving climbing and swimming. In addition, for each pair of arms it has\u2014the Multiple Arms value divided by 2\u2014it may make an additional attack as if wielding multiple melee weapons (the creature must either have natural weapons or actual melee weapons to wield for this to take effect). Note, that a creature still requires Two Weapon Wielder (Melee) to make multiple attacks in the same turn."},"Natural Armor":{name:"Natural Armor",tier:0,description:"This creature has a naturally tough hide or an exoskeleton, affording it some protection against attacks.

It counts as being armed even when not wielding weapons. Its attacks deal 1d10 points of Damage plus its Strength Bonus. The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed\u2014unless, of course its limbs are hacked off ! (In general, creatures with Natural Weapons are immune to the Power Field quality, as it\u2019s assumed they have enough teeth, claws, or spines to ignore a few being removed.) Natural weapons have the Primitive (7) Special Quality, unless stated otherwise in the profile."},Phase:{name:"Phase",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait can transform its body into an insubstantial state, passing ghost-like through solid objects or barriers of any sort. This trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action. Phase carries additional limitations. A creature in a phased state cannot cross psychically charged barriers, holy wards, or energy fields designed to flux space or manipulate the warp, such as a Gellar Field or a Void Shield."},Psyker:{name:"Psyker",tier:0,description:"Whether due to unnatural influences, the study of forbidden lore, or simply sheer force of will, this individual is a Psyker, and can bend the Immaterium to his will. Though this Trait has no benefits on its own, it allows characters to purchase the Psyniscience Skill and the Psy Rating and Psychic Power Talents."},Possession:{name:"Possession",tier:0,description:"Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to \u201cwear\u201d the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim\u2019s living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately."},Quadruped:{name:"Quadruped",tier:0,description:"Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. There movement is double that normally indicated by their Agility Bonus (see page 39). This trait is intended to cover creatures with hind legs and forepaws. Creatures with more than four legs may gain this Trait as well increasing their movement as indicated above but adding an addition 2 to their final movement rate (after doubling) for each set of legs beyond the first two (i.e. +2 for 6 legs, +4 for 8 legs etc)."},Regeneration:{name:"Regeneration",tier:0,description:"Creatures with this trait heal very quickly. Each round, at the start of its turn, the creature makes a Toughness Test to removes an amount of Damage indicated in the parenthesis after the trait. It loses this trait when slain."},Size:{name:"Size",tier:0,description:"Creatures come in one of ten different size categories, as shown on Table 4-8: Size. Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected and how easy or hard it is to strike in combat. When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents (such as Quadruped). For the purposes of comparison, a human is a Size (4) creature. Note, a creature\u2019s movement cannot be reduced to less than 1."},"Sonar Sense":{name:"Sonar Sense",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres. Other creatures within this 30 metre range, and that succeed on an Awareness Skill Test at -10, may detect the curious keening."},"Soul Bound":{name:"Soul Bound",tier:0,description:"The soul of this creature is bound to a higher power or being, in return for a measure of protection. When this Trait is fi rst gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos Sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result. (Essentially, he may replace either the ones die or the tens die with the extra die he rolls) Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points (this does not apply to Heretics, as they do not suffer Insanity), the permanent loss of their sight, permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic, or a random mutation. In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently indebted to the entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner of other duties and consequences."},Stampede:{name:"Stampede",tier:0,description:"Whenever a creature with this trait fails a Willpower Test, it automatically stampedes, charging in a straight line forwards as far as possible, overrunning anything in its path until the source of danger has escaped or is crushed under hoof, taking Damage equal to the creature\u2019s Natural Weapon Damage (or 1d5+SB I if it doesn\u2019t have one). One stampeding creature automatically causes all other creatures within sight to stampede. The stampede lasts until the source of danger is no longer visible or for 1d10 minutes, whichever occurs last."},"Strange Physiology":{name:"Strange Physiology",tier:0,description:"A creature with this Trait has an unusual, alien, or altogether bizarre anatomy. All hits count as Body hits and death results when damage equals or exceeds the creature\u2019s Wounds."},Sturdy:{name:"Sturdy",tier:0,description:"Sturdy creatures are hard to move and thus gain a +20 bonus to tests made to resist grappling and uses of the Takedown Talent."},Swarm:{name:"Swarm",tier:0,description:"Too small to do much on their own, swarms overwhelm their opponents via sheer weight of numbers. A swarm is often a mass of Miniscule or Puny creatures. Any attack from a weapon that does not either have the Blast, Flame, Spray, or Scatter Qualities only inflicts half Damage. In most circumstances, a swarm creature cannot be Grappled, Knocked Down, or Pinned, and the swarm may \u201cpour\u201d through suitable small openings such as ducts, vents, and the like, but they may not Jump. The swarm is counted as being destroyed once all its Wounds are lost. The swarm\u2019s attacks have a variable Penetration value (roll each time an attack lands), representing its ability to engulf their victims and attack vulnerable areas."},"The Stuff of Nightmares":{name:"The Stuff Of Nightmares",tier:0,description:"Some warp entities are so terribly powerful the will perpetuating their bodies in our reality is almost impossible to break or disrupt. Such entities are completely immune to the effects of poisons, diseases, the need to breathe, most environmental hazards, bleeding, stunning. They also ignore any critical result other than one that would destroy them outright, unless it was caused by a psychic power, force weapon, or holy attack."},"Touched by the Fates":{name:"Touched by the Fates",tier:0,description:"The creature or NPC has a number of Fate Points shown in parenthesis (X). It may use these Fate Points in exactly the same way as Player Characters and may even \u2018burn\u2019 a Fate Point to survive death and destruction at the GM\u2019s discretion. The rules for Zealous Hatred also apply to this creature or NPC."},Toxic:{name:"Toxic",tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait is poisonous Some weapons rely on toxins and poisons to do their damage. Anyone that successfully deals damage to a Toxic creature must make a Toughness Test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parenthesis (X) or suffer 1d10 points of Damage (of the same type as the weapon which inflicted the hit) not reduced by armour or Toughness. For example a creature with Toxic (4) would impose a \u201340 on Toughness Tests. Some creatures may carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more Damage as indicated in their individual descriptions."},Undying:{name:"Undying",tier:0,description:"This creature has a strange and ill understood physiology. It cannot be harmed by diseases, poisons, or toxic effects. It has no need to breathe and can survive unaided in a vacuum."},"Unnatural Characteristic":{name:"Unnatural Characteristic",tier:0,description:"One or more of the creature\u2019s Characteristics is unnatural. This is indicated by a number which is then added directly to the creature\u2019s Characteristic Bonus. For example, a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a 4 Strength Bonus. If the creature had Unnatural Characteristic Strength (3) then its Strength Bonus increases to 7 (4+3). A creature may have this Trait more than once. Each time, it is applied to a new Characteristic. In addition, whenever someone with an Unnatural Characteristic succeeds on a Test utilizing that Characteristic, they gain a number of bonus Degrees of Success equal to half of their Unnatural Characteristic."},"Unnatural Senses":{name:"Unnatural Senses",tier:0,description:"The creature can perceive its surroundings using senses other than sight or hearing, using special organs, fine hairs, or some other disturbing trait to make itself aware of what\u2019s around it. This trait always includes a range in metres indicated by the number in parenthesis (X)"},"Warp Instability":{name:"Warp Instability",tier:0,description:"Most warp-entities have a tenuous hold on our reality, often maintained only by horror and bloodshed, and may be disrupted if sufficient harm can be done to their manifested forms. If a creature with this trait takes Damage and does not deal Damage or Insanity Points on other creatures by the end of its next turn, it must make a Willpower Test. The creature takes 1d5 Damage for failure, plus 1 Damage for each Degree of Failure. This Damage cannot be prevented by any means including armour and Toughness. If this would deal Damage equal to or in excess of the creature\u2019s Wounds, it is cast back into the warp."},"Warp Weapons":{name:"Warp Weapons",tier:0,description:"Creatures with this trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as armour or cover.
