Using a power with an invocation grants the psyker a +1 bonus to his Psy Rating, after determining Psychic Strength. This bonus to PR does not in\ufb02uence the Psychic Strength in any way; their bene\ufb01t is applied after determining whether a power is used at the Unfettered, Fettered or Push level. However, the psyker must add +20 to any roll on the Psychic Phenomena table.

This talent may be used at any time by a character as long as he has at least an hour to perform his ritual of contempt (a player may say his character has already performed the ritual before play begins if the GM agrees). The character must also spend one Infamy Point. During the game session whenever the character is the subject of the effects of a psychic power, daemonic power or other warp based power, he may make a Willpower Test (make this test before any tests he would normally be permitted to resist the effects of the power). If the Willpower test is passed the character is unaffected by the psychic power. If the test is failed then the psychic power affects him as normal and he becomes Frenzied in addition to any other effects. The effects of this talent only apply to powers that directly affect the character (such as targeted powers or powers which catch him in their area of effect) and not powers which may harm him indirectly (such as attack from summoned daemons or falling or flung debris from a telekinetic). In addition, powers used by friendly psykers must also be resisted (and also cause Frenzy should he fail to resist them).

The downside, however, is that the warp is always partially manifest in his presence and he generates constant psychic phenomena. At the start of each game session the character should roll 1d10 on Table 4-4: Child of the Warp to determine the nature of these persistent effects which follow him for the duration of the session."},"Cold Hearted":{name:"Cold Hearted",tier:1,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Seduction attempts against him automatically fail, and he gains a +20 to his Willpower when making Opposed Tests against an opponent using the Charm Skill.

The psyker may gain a number of bonus Degrees of Success no greater than his Toughness Bonus on his Focus Power Test. However, for every Degree of Success gained in this way, the psyker suffers 1d10 Toughness Damage (note, this is not permanent Toughness Damage) and one Corruption Point as the energies of the warp poison his body from within.

Whenever the character could detect such warp signature or creature the GM may allow him to make a Psyniscience Skill Test to detect it, in the same way he might use Awareness to spot an ambush without knowing it is there."},"Weapon Training":{name:"Weapon Training",tier:1,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"The character can use all weapons with Class: Pistol, Basic, Heavy, Throwing, and Melee within the group he has selected with this talent. When a character attempts to use a weapon he does not have the correct Weapon Training Talent for, he suffers a \u201320 penalty to any relevant Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill Test. This talent may be taken more than once, each time with a different specialisation."},"Weapon Tech":{name:"Weapon Tech",tier:1,prerequisites:"Tech Use +10, Int 40",devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Once per combat, the character can enhance his weapon increasing it \ufb01repower and deadliness.

It can change size by one-step in either direction, though doing so does not change its speed. Creatures with this trait determine their movement rates using one-half their Agility Bonus rounded up. Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on the Unnatural Senses Trait to perceive their surroundings."},"Auto-Stabilised":{name:"Auto-Stabilised",devotion:U.UNALIGNED,tier:0,description:"The creature always counts as braced when firing heavy weapons and therefore may fire a ranged weapon on full or semi-automatic without taking the Brace action first without suffering any penalties to hit."},Bestial:{name:"Bestial",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"A creature with this trait is animalistic, tending to behave instinctively rather than rationally. No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this trait never needs to make a Survival Skill Test whilst in its natural habitat.

On a failed test, the creature flees."},Blind:{name:"Blind",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Blind creatures automatically fail all tests based on vision and automatically fail all Ballistic Skill Tests. Such creatures take a \u201330 penalty to Weapon Skill Tests and most other tests that ordinarily involve or are benefited by vision. Note that this Trait indicates not only that the creature cannot see but that it also has no other senses which would provide the same benefit as eyes. The Blind Fighting Talent reduces the penalties to Weapon Skill Tests as normal for Blind creatures, reducing it from \u201330 to \u201315."},"Brutal Charge":{name:"Brutal Charge",devotion:U.UNALIGNED,tier:0,description:"A creature with this trait deals an extra (X) points of damage per attack when it charges in the same round."},Burrower:{name:"Burrower",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"A creature with this trait can move through solid objects by burrowing through them. The number in parenthesis (X) indicates its speed when burrowing. Such creatures can burrow through soil, rock, sand, and so on, though some (expressed in the creature entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one-size smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter these areas without impediment. There\u2019s a 50% chance each round that the tunnel collapses behind the creature."},Crawler:{name:"Crawler",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Worms, serpents, and similar creatures crawl and slither rather than walk.

Creatures with this trait increase their Toughness Bonus against all Damage by the number indicated in the parenthesis (X) in the same manner as an Unnatural Characteristic (see Unnatural Characteristics trait on page 144). The effects of this trait stack with the effects of the Unnatural Characteristic trait. This increase is negated by Damage inflicted by force weapons, psychic powers, holy attacks, or other creatures with this trait. Daemonic creatures are also immune to poison and disease.

The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going encounter, as shown on Table 4-7: Fear Ratings. When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, they must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature\u2019s trait. On a success, the character may act as normal.

An incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Stealth Tests due to their ability to merge with objects and the fact they make practically no sounds when they move. Incorporeal creatures gain the Hoverer (6) trait. An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons\u2014they simply pass through its body as if it wasn\u2019t there. Daemons, psychic powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can\u2019t normally affect the mortal world, and thus can\u2019t Damage non-incorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent. Creatures with the Incorporeal trait can Damage other creatures with the Incorporeal trait normally. Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay, most notably the Gellar Field of a spaceship. Creatures with this trait cannot pass through such a field."},Machine:{name:"Machine",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"A creature with the Machine trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous then fleshy folks. Machines do not breathe, are immune to the effects of a vacuum, extremes of cold, any mind-influencing psychic effect, and their Armour Points apply toward fire Damage.

The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed\u2014unless, of course its limbs are hacked off ! (In general, creatures with Natural Weapons are immune to the Power Field quality, as it\u2019s assumed they have enough teeth, claws, or spines to ignore a few being removed.)

This trait functions exactly like the Incorporeal trait, except the creature may become solid or insubstantial by spending a Half Action. Phase carries additional limitations.

This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to \u201cwear\u201d the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim\u2019s living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to bind and control daemons in living vessels, are a special case and dealt with separately."},Quadruped:{name:"Quadruped",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Quadrupeds are much quicker over a distance than their bipedal counterparts. There movement is double that normally indicated by their Agility Bonus (see page 39). This trait is intended to cover creatures with hind legs and forepaws.

It loses this trait when slain."},Size:{name:"Size",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Creatures come in one of ten different size categories, as shown on Table 4-8: Size. Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected and how easy or hard it is to strike in combat. When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other Traits or Talents (such as Quadruped). For the purposes of comparison, a human is a Size (4) creature. Note, a creature\u2019s movement cannot be reduced to less than 1."},"Sonar Sense":{name:"Sonar Sense",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"A creature with this trait perceives its surroundings by emitting a frequency noise, allowing the creature to locate the position of any solid object within 30 metres.

When this Trait is fi rst gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos Sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result. (Essentially, he may replace either the ones die or the tens die with the extra die he rolls) Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points (this does not apply to Heretics, as they do not suffer Insanity), the permanent loss of their sight, permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic, or a random mutation.

A swarm is often a mass of Miniscule or Puny creatures. Any attack from a weapon that does not either have the Blast, Flame, Spray, or Scatter Qualities only inflicts half Damage. In most circumstances, a swarm creature cannot be Grappled, Knocked Down, or Pinned, and the swarm may \u201cpour\u201d through suitable small openings such as ducts, vents, and the like, but they may not Jump. The swarm is counted as being destroyed once all its Wounds are lost.

The creature takes 1d5 Damage for failure, plus 1 Damage for each Degree of Failure. This Damage cannot be prevented by any means including armour and Toughness. If this would deal Damage equal to or in excess of the creature\u2019s Wounds, it is cast back into the warp."},"Warp Weapons":{name:"Warp Weapons",tier:0,devotion:U.UNALIGNED,description:"Creatures with this trait have weapons that are partially insubstantial, able to ignore such mundane things as armour or cover.
