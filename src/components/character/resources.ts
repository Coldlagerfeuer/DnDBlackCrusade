This talent has no effect on hostile targets, and only affects NPCs." },

Special: When combined with the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent, the penalty for making attacks with both weapons in the same Turn drops to –10." },

The character can command special respect from other veterans of the Long War and gains a +10 to all Fellowship Tests and Skill Tests based on Fellowship when dealing with such NPCs. In addition, Chaos Space Marine Minions of the character increase their loyalty by +10. Long War weaponry is also easier for him to obtain and all weapons with the word “Legion” in the title count as one Availability category easier than normal (i.e. Rare becomes Scarce, Scarce becomes Average, etc.). Finally, veterans of the Long War are despised by the Imperium and the Adeptus Astartes especially, and should the character’s past become known by these powers it is likely to end in blood…" },

This bonus applies only to armour worn by the character as it combines his training as much as his skill at armoury." },
    "Arms Master": { name: "Arms Master", tier: 3, prerequisites: "WS 40, BS 40, Weapon Training (any two)", devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "When the Heretic uses a weapon he is untrained in, he only suffers a –10 penalty, rather than a –20. The only exceptions to the Arms Master Talent are exotic weapons, which are so unusual or rare that they always require their own weapon training Talents to use without penalty and gain no bonus when combined with this talent." },
    "Assassin Strike": { name: "Assassin Strike", tier: 3, prerequisites: "Ag 40, Acrobatics", devotion: EGods.SLAANESH, description: "After making a melee attack, a successful Acrobatics Skill Test allows the character to move at half rate as a Free Action. The character’s opponent does not receive a free attack resulting from this move. The character may only make this move once per round." },
    "Baleful Dirge": { name: "Baleful Dirge", tier: 2, prerequisites: "Disturbing Voice, Intimidate +10", devotion: EGods.NURGLE, description: "Singing the dirge takes some concentration and requires a Half Action each round to maintain. All creatures which can hear the character within a 30-metre radius must make a Willpower Test or suffer a –10 on their next roll. As long as the dirge is maintained, all those affected by it must test each turn to see if they suffer its effects. Once a creature passes a Willpower Test however, it has completely overcome the dirge and is not affected by it for the remainder of the encounter." },

Such calculated cruelty boosts the Heretic’s reputation, granting him a +10 bonus on his next Infamy Test if the victim was an NPC and +20 if it was a Minion (and harder to replace). Killing NPCs and Minions usually has consequences as well which should be determined by the GM." },

If taken with the Ambidextrous Talent, this drops the penalty to +0." },
    "Blasphemous Incantation": { name: "Blasphemous Incantation", tier: 3, prerequisites: "Psy Rating", devotion: EGods.TZEENTCH, description: "Using a power with an incantation increases the Focus Power Test by a Half Action, as the psyker requires a few moments to speak the required words. Powers for which the Focus Power Test takes a Reaction cannot be used with an invocation. Using a power with an invocation grants the psyker a +1 bonus to his Psy Rating, after determining Psychic Strength. This bonus to PR does not inﬂuence the Psychic Strength in any way; their beneﬁt is applied after determining whether a power is used at the Unfettered, Fettered or Push level. However, the psyker must add +20 to any roll on the Psychic Phenomena table. Finally, any result of 91 or higher on the Focus Power Test is an automatic failure that results in Perils of the Warp." },
    "Blind Fighting": { name: "Blind Fighting", tier: 1, prerequisites: "Per 30", devotion: EGods.TZEENTCH, description: "This talent reduces all penalties for ﬁghting with a melee weapon while suffering from obscured vision by half (rounded up), permitting the character to ﬁght in fog, smoke or darkness more effectively. See page 245 for a full list of attack penalties based on lighting and vision. Note this talent only improves a character’s chances to hit with melee weapons and has not effect on ranged weapon attacks." },
    "Blood God's Contempt": { name: "Blood God's Contempt", tier: 3, prerequisites: "Frenzy, WP 40", devotion: EGods.KHORNE, description: "The character spends the time before battle armouring himself against the power of the warp by cursing the names of sorcerers and showing his fearlessness before his feeble power and all those who wield the power of the warp. This talent may be used at any time by a character as long as he has at least an hour to perform his ritual of contempt (a player may say his character has already performed the ritual before play begins if the GM agrees). The character must also spend one Infamy Point. During the game session whenever the character is the subject of the effects of a psychic power, daemonic power or other warp based power, he may make a Willpower Test (make this test before any tests he would normally be permitted to resist the effects of the power). If the Willpower test is passed the character is unaffected by the psychic power. If the test is failed then the psychic power affects him as normal and he becomes Frenzied in addition to any other effects. The effects of this talent only apply to powers that directly affect the character (such as targeted powers or powers which catch him in their area of effect) and not powers which may harm him indirectly (such as attack from summoned daemons or falling or flung debris from a telekinetic). In addition, powers used by friendly psykers must also be resisted (and also cause Frenzy should he fail to resist them). A power that is resisted by a character using this talent is not nullified an others are affected by it as normal." },
    "Bolter Drill": { name: "Bolter Drill", tier: 3, prerequisites: "Weapon Training (Bolt), BS 40", devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "When ﬁring any class of Bolt weapon on full or semi-auto the character may score one additional Degree of Success (provided the Test is successful) if he does not take a Move Action in his turn." },

    "Catfall": { name: "Catfall", tier: 1, devotion: EGods.SLAANESH, description: "The character automatically reduces the distance of all falls by a number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus, ignoring this distance as if it did not exist. In addition the character adds +20 to his Acrobatics Skill Tests when using the Jump Special Skill Use as it pertains to reducing Damage from falling." },
    "Child of the Warp": { name: "Child of the Warp", tier: 2, prerequisites: "Psy Rating", devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "This grants greater connection to the warp and increases the character’s Psy Rating by +1 when he chooses to Push . The downside, however, is that the warp is always partially manifest in his presence and he generates constant psychic phenomena. At the start of each game session the character should roll 1d10 on Table 4-4: Child of the Warp to determine the nature of these persistent effects which follow him for the duration of the session." },
    "Cold Hearted": { name: "Cold Hearted", tier: 1, devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "Seduction attempts against him automatically fail, and he gains a +20 to his Willpower when making Opposed Tests against an opponent using the Charm Skill.

    "Corpus Conversion": { name: "Corpus Conversion", tier: 2, prerequisites: "Psy Rating, Human", devotion: EGods.NURGLE, description: "A psyker with the Corpus Conversion Talent gains access to this Path to Power, and may elect to use it before he attempts his Focus Power Test. The psyker may gain a number of bonus Degrees of Success no greater than his Toughness Bonus on his Focus Power Test. However, for every Degree of Success gained in this way, the psyker suffers 1d10 Toughness Damage (note, this is not permanent Toughness Damage) and one Corruption Point as the energies of the warp poison his body from within. Traitor Legion characters may not beneﬁt from Corpus Conversion; the taint-resistant metabolism of the Astartes makes them incapable of burning away his ﬂesh to fuel warp-based powers." },
    "Counter Attack": { name: "Counter Attack", tier: 2, prerequisites: "WS 40", devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "After successfully parrying an opponent’s attack, the character may immediately make an attack against that opponent using the weapon with which he parried as a Free Action even though it is not his turn.

He must roll a 1d5 on the Cursed Heirloom Table for any weapon or armour giving it a permanent curse. He is now bonded to the item and even if it is lost, destroyed, or stolen it always somehow turns up in its original condition at the start of the next game session. Such items also usually come with a history of their own and the GM should feel free to have the item’s past come back to haunt the character from time to time" },
    "Deadeye Shot": { name: "Deadeye Shot", tier: 1, prerequisites: "BS 30", devotion: EGods.TZEENTCH, description: "When making a Called Shot (see page 234) ranged attack, the character reduces the penalty by 10 (so a –20 becomes a –10 instead)." },

No matter how high its Intelligence score is, it is still bestial. A creature with this trait never needs to make a Survival Skill Test whilst in its natural habitat.

The higher the Fear Rating the harder it is for others to resist going encounter, as shown on Table 4-7: Fear Ratings. When a character encounters a creature with this Trait, they must make a Willpower Test, modified by the severity of the creature’s trait. On a success, the character may act as normal.

Incorporeal creatures gain the Hoverer (6) trait. An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal weapons—they simply pass through its body as if it wasn’t there. Daemons, psychic powers, warp creatures, other incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An incorporeal creature can’t normally affect the mortal world, and thus can’t Damage non-incorporeal opponents unless it has a suitable special ability or Talent.

The creature may make attacks with its Natural Weapons using its Weapon Skill, though it cannot parry with its natural weapons, nor can it be disarmed—unless, of course its limbs are hacked off !

    "Possession": {name: "Possession", tier: 0, devotion: EGods.UNALIGNED, description: "Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or even the power of the strongest psykers to “wear” the bodies of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is merged with the victim’s living body on a fundamental level so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below, although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may vary.

Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected and how easy or hard it is to strike in combat.

When this Trait is fi rst gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths, are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos Sorcerers may be bound to one of the Ruinous Powers. A soul-bound psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he chooses to get a more favourable result. (Essentially, he may replace either the ones die or the tens die with the extra die he rolls) Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points (this does not apply to Heretics, as they do not suffer Insanity), the permanent loss of their sight, permanent loss of 1d10 from one Characteristic, or a random mutation.
